<h1>Kristy's Top 3 Movie Picks</h1>
<h2>These are the best! Don't miss out!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>This is the start of an epic journey. You may remember the famous meme about Boromir and Mordor from the movie.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>Being the second leg of the trilogy, it continues to wow audience with grand battle scenes. The acting is underrated.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>The perfect ending to the story. The only bad thing about the movie is that it's too short! The extended edition is the one to go for.</p>
