<h1>About Kristy</h1>

<p>I am an aspiring coder in web development.
  It is my passion to take up new challenges and learn new knowledge and skills.
  I was a competitive swimmer in secondary school. I play tennis.
  I speak Cantonese (which is my mother tongue), English and Mandarin. I know a tiny bit of Italian.
  I love doing the 12-hour long the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (extended edition) marathon once in a while.
  Since getting my first degree in 2010, I have gained work experience in different areas, including office administration, complaints management and HR.
  I studied a part-time master's degree between 2018 and 2020 while working full-time.
  My most recent ventures are moving from Hong Kong to the UK in 2021, and working as a driving instructor since May 2023.

<p>I've always had a strong interest in tech. Back in school days, I loved customizing my Xanga blog and add all sorts of cool features to it like music player, cards, dividers, etc. I didn't know I was already coding back then.
  When working in the office, I always found ways to streamline or simplify the job using the IT knowledge I knew.
  Although it's nothing complicated (just something like setting up a mail merge in MS Word and designing formulas in MS Excel), those new ways of work greatly enhance work efficiency and avoided possible human errors.
  I thought about learning to code but always thought it would be impossible without formal education like getting a degree.
  However, the success story of a friend inspired me. He joined a free bootcamp and undertook a lot of self-learning, and he got a job in tech.
  This encouraged me to go ahead and learn to programme. So here we are!
